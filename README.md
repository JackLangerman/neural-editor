How to run on slurm cluster
  1) first make sure to set the `HOME` variable in both `setup_datadir.sh` and `train_slurm.s`.  
  2) to get the data run `./setup_datadir.sh`  
  3) to submit a batch job for training run `sbatch train_slurm.s`   (you can change the config in this file)

- We are drafting a more detailed README in the
  [README](https://github.com/kelvinguu/neural-editor/tree/readme) branch (see here for dataset links)
- This is research code meant to serve as a reference implementation. We do not
  recommend heavily extending or modifying this codebase for other purposes.
